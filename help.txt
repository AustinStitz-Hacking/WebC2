Welcome to WebC2!

I see you're trying to set up command and control in client-side JavaScript?
Maybe some XSS up your sleeve?
Well you're in luck!

Might need a few commands to help you get started!

:sessions - View the connected sessions. These are not necessarily open and may time out if closed (or depending on the command you enter).
:set_session <session> - Set the session. Use the number, not the string!
:add_session <session string> - Add a session that is already connected! If you exit out and still have the string, you might be able to recover it!
:dump - Dump stored data in localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies!
:vars - View saved global variables!
:var <variable> - View saved variable, such as dumped data!
:session_vars - View saved session variables for this particular session! 
:session_var <variable> - View saved variable for this session! If you have multiple sessions, this can help keep track of what dumped data is for what session!
:help - View this help menu!
:exit/:q - Exit WebC2. This will not close out on the open sessions, but they just won't do anything!


While you might want to stop this program from time to time, when it comes to being the best version of your self, never :q!

Remember to only use this for legal reasons. If used on a website without permission, you will be likely to get in trouble with the authorities. ONLY use this with permission.

Examples of usage include:
 - Web or external penetration testing
 - Bug bounty where you have XSS on a page you can't see
 - Red-teaming
 - Capture-the-flag competitions or practice boxes (HTB/THM/etc.)

This can help enumerate when you have XSS but can't see where you have it, but only use this responsibly!

Happy hacking!
