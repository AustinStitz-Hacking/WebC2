Welcome to WebC2!

I see you're trying to set up command and control in client-side JavaScript?
Maybe some XSS up your sleeve?
Well you're in luck!

This main command has a few flags you'll need to set to get started!

--help - Show this message
-p <port> - Set the listener port
-h/--host <host> - Set the host (localhost, domain name, IP, etc.)

It's pretty simple! Most of the stuff you will need will be after the server is hosted and you have your C2 terminal!


Once you enter the terminal, you can view available commands through typing :help.


While you might want to stop this program from time to time, when it comes to being the best version of your self, never :q!

Remember to only use this for legal reasons. If used on a website without permission, you will be likely to get in trouble with the authorities. ONLY use this with permission.

Examples of usage include:
 - Web or external penetration testing
 - Bug bounty where you have XSS on a page you can't see
 - Red-teaming
 - Capture-the-flag competitions or practice boxes (HTB/THM/etc.)

This can help enumerate when you have XSS but can't see where you have it, but only use this responsibly!

Happy hacking!
